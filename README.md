Carwin
======

A self-driving car implemented with neural networks and genetic algorithms (AI Course Project)

This project is a study (and a implementation) of neural networks potentials in a context where a 
car learns itself how to drive into a set of circuits.
Connected with the developed neural network there is a genetic algorithm based on "Darwin's natural selection law".

Requirements
------------

The entire work has been made using the Unity3D Game Engine 4.0 (http://www.unity3d.com) and Google Sketchup (http://sketchup.google.com/).
The reason of this choice is that we needed a fast way to represent 3D models with physical properties, but there are no 
limitations to develop projects like this in other ways, languages or systems.

Usage 
-----

* To test the final version of Carwin just go into carwin-build folder and open the html file. 
Note that you must install the Unity3D Web Player to run it.
* For hackers, go in carwin-unityproj folder and open Assets/defaultScene.unity to have the full control of this project under Unity3D.
The source files you are probably interested to are in Assets/Scripts/CarControl folder. Enjoy!
