A self-driving car implemented with neural networks and genetic algorithms (AI Course Project)

This project is a study (and a implementation) of neural networks potentials in a context where a 
car learns itself how to drive into a set of circuits.
Connected with the developed neural network there is a genetic algorithm based on "Darwin's natural selection law".

Requirements
------------

The entire work has been made using the Unity3D Game Engine (http://www.unity3d.com), Blender (http//www.blender.org) and
Google Skecthup (http://sketchup.google.com/)
The reason of this choice is that we needed a fast way to represent 3D models with physical properties, but there are no 
limitations to develop projects like this in other ways, languages or systems.
